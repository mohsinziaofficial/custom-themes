                Grunberg was recommended to me by a mutual contact and when I first met with Alexander Kossoff and the rest of the team, I could see that they were very professional and proactive.

                As a start-up having a good accountant is integral to running a business smoothly, & Grunberg are beyond just good! We didn’t realise how good they were until we cheated on them and realised what a mistake that was so went back as quickly as possible

                It is with pleasure I write this testimonial for Grunberg and more particularly Alexander Kossoff and his team. Sufficive to say they have an extensive knowledge of their field but for me their willingness to help beyond the call of duty has been paramount.

                We worked with Grunberg for many years and always found their breadth and depth of knowledge reassuring and extremely helpful. The team at Grunberg provided us with advice and support throughout the year, as well as preparation of our annual accounts.

                Grunberg are problem solvers! They are by far the best company we work with for our support. They are always available for help with the simple and the obscurer.

                Grunberg is a highly skilled and respected chartered accountancy firm. I have been with Grunberg for a quarter of a century and I think to sustain a strong working relationship for that time says an awful lot about them.

                After switching from our previous accountant, we have nothing but positive things to say about Grunberg. Very friendly staff, efficient and quality work at affordable prices, we would definitely recommend Grunberg to a small business like us.

                Grunberg have been offering me advice for nearly 30 years. This relationship began when I was a sole trader at my dining room table and has continued to the present day. It has always been the most enjoyable association.

                Grunberg have looked after my personal and corporate tax affairs for over ten years. They are a pleasure to work with and I would have no hesitation in recommending them to anyone who is looking for an accountancy firm to work alongside them.

                The tax department has helped us navigate through the complexities of Corporation Tax, and we have also used the tax department for shareholder related issues. The difference with Grunberg is that the partners understand their clients&apos; businesses.
