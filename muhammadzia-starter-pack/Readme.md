# Theme Overview

This theme provides a clean and structured layout suitable for building professional websites. It offers a well-organized design that ensures a smooth user experience while maintaining flexibility for customization.

## Features

### Basic Yet Well-Structured Layout
The theme includes a foundational yet comprehensive layout that can be easily adapted to various types of websites. It follows best practices for design and functionality, making it suitable for beginners and experienced developers alike.

### Optional Support for Advanced Custom Fields (ACF)
For users who want additional customization options, the theme includes optional integration with the [Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) plugin](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/). This allows you to add custom titles for inner pages.

**Example Usage:**  
Suppose you have a page named **"Services"**, but you want to display a custom title like **"Our Special Services"** on the front end. Using ACF, you can easily set a custom title while keeping the page name intact for backend organization.

**Note:**  
To use this feature, you need to install and activate the **Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) plugin** separately.

## Installation

1. Download and extract the theme files.
2. Upload the theme folder to the `/wp-content/themes/` directory.
3. Activate the theme from the WordPress admin dashboard under **Appearance > Themes**.
4. (Optional) Install and activate the **ACF plugin** if you wish to use custom titles for inner pages.
