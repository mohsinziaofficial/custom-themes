## Features

### Basic Yet Well-Structured Layout

### Optional Support for Advanced Custom Fields (ACF)
For users who want additional customization options, the theme includes optional integration with the [Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) plugin](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/). This allows you to add custom titles for inner pages.

To use this feature, you need to install and activate the **Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) plugin** separately.
